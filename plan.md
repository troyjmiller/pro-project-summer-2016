# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Summer 2016



The goal of my time in the Pro class this summer is to create a Poker, or Texas Hold 'em, simulator/working game. I have figured that there will be an element of difficulty into creating this game becuase of all the randomness of it. There will have to be blocks of code dedicated to all possibilities possible in a game of poker; every single new shuffle of a deck is a new shuffle that has never been created before. I am intrigued by the amount of possibilites and wish to figure out how to do this. Adding more hands would create an even harder project.

## Objectives

I need to re-learn some of my Python because although it was the first language I learned here I have lost some of my touch with it after learning both Javascript and Go. Learing how to tinker with the randomness of the game of poker is something that I would need to understand. Art would be an issuee because I am not an amazing artist.
