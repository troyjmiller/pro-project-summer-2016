# SkilStak Pro Project Plan - Summer 2016

*Text in italics is for explanation and can be deleted.*

*The goal of my time in the Pro class this summer is to create a Poker, or Texas Hold 'em, simulator/working game. I have figured that there will be an element of difficulty into creating this game becuase of all the randomness of it. There will have to be blocks of code dedicated to all possibilities possible in a game of poker; every single new shuffle of a deck is a new shuffle that has never been created before. I am intrigued by the amount of possibilites and wish to figure out how to do this. Adding more hands would create an even harder project.*

## Objectives

*I need to re-learn some of my Python because although it was the first language I learned here I have lost some of my touch with it after learning both Javascript and Go. Learing how to tinker with the randomness of the game of poker is something that I would need to understand. Art would be an issuee because I am not an amazing artist.*

* Read [schedule][] and understand the Pro commitment and responsibility
* Change these objectives to project plan objectives
* Delete the comments from this project plan
* Keep my Pro invite by completing all project deliverables

*Most Pro projects will have one or more other repos or even an
organization to contain the actual source code. Link to it here.
The idea is that the projects created in Pro could live on their
own without being associated with the SkilStak Pro program.*

*Every Pro student must open at least one GitHub Enhancement issue
on two different Pro project plan repos by the third week of class
or lose their Pro invite.*

*The quality of all comments made on others projects will be taken
into consideration for further Pro invites. Silly or extraneous
comments will not be considered comments resulting in an immediate
loss of the invite.*
